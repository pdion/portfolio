                <b>Discovered the internet in 1996 while in college.</b> It changed my life! I realised I spent all my free time on the computer room. I also discovered linux and installed the slash distribution on my computer. 32 floppy disks of pure joy.

                <b>Got a university certificate at HEC Montreal, a renown management university.</b> I took some marketing classes at the same time. After working as a project manager for a year and an half I realised I much prefer to code.

                <b>I have a culture of self-teaching.</b> Most of the technologies I use to work with(Perl or Flash anyone?) are not in use anymore. I always learn new things and try to push technologies to their edges.
