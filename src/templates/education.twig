        <h1>My education</h1>
        <p>I first wanted to study physic and discover all the mysteries of quantum mechanis. Then I discovered the internet and it changed my life. I realised I spent all my time in the computer lab! I decided to switch to a college major in computering. The cursus didn't include any class about the internet, so I did a college minor in networking management and administration. I learnt to code in perl at my first job. Later I decided to advance my career and do a certificate in project management at HEC Montreal university with some classes in marketing. But I realised I way prefer to code. And here I am!</p>
